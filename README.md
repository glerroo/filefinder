# ![](/data/icons/filefinder.png) File Finder
**File Finder** is an advanced native graphical file search tool and an integration with Gnome Nautilus file explorer through the Nautilus Extension.
There is asynchronous threaded file search in multiple locations, a file masking, MIME types, modified dates, file sizes, text and binary patterns.
It means results appear before a search ends, you can cancel a searching anytime. File Finder can search in multiple locations like files, folders, mount points, disks at the same time. Search queries can contain multiple search filters and text patterns and process them all together.
The search results can be sorted by attributes and processed with common actions like opening with a default application, a containing folder, copy/move to a destination folder, trashing selection, and handled by internal plug-in's manager based on standard Shell Script.
It can be used for an automation on the search results.
Any shell script like bash, python, gjs can be converted to the File Finder Extension by adding the simple definitions in the scripts.

### From source
```
git clone https://github.com/konkor/filefinder.git
cd filefinder
./autogen.sh

**Optionally**, after `sudo make install`, you could require to copy/move nautilus extension from _/usr/local/lib_ to _/usr/lib_ (old Autotools versions only) otherwise Nautilus couldn't see extensions in the _/usr/local/lib_ folder.
```
sudo cp /usr/local/lib/nautilus/extensions-3.0/* /usr/lib/nautilus/extensions-3.0/
```
Now you can restart Nautilus to reload extensions.
```
nautilus -q
```

To disable Nautilus extension pass `--without-nautilus-extension` to _autogen.sh_ or _configure_:
```
./configure --without-nautilus-extension
make
sudo make install
